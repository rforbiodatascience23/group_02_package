### Decription of package 

### Function 1 description

### Function 2 description

This function takes as input a DNA sequence and generates the corresponding RNA sequence. It does this by converging the nucleotide T (thymine) into U (uracil). The remaining nucleotides, A, C, and G, will remain unchanged as these are identical in DNA and RNA.
The input DNA sequence must not contain any other symbols than the four nucleotides (A, C, G, T), as well as be clear of spaces and new lines.
